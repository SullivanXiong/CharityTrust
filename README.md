# CharityTrust
#A decentralized block chain community based charity platform.

CharityTrust is a decentralized blockchain application built on the Ethereum network with Solidity and it has a friendly user interface on the web for both Users and Charities to easily use to interact with the Smart Contracts. Through the use of Smart Contracts, we remove the third party middlemen servicers like KickStarter, crowdfund, and etc. By removing the middleman we can be assured 100% of the time that the money WILL reach the charities not just securely, but  also instantaneously. I developed CharityTrust because I believe that there's a lack in addressing the issue of middlemen services and that there needed to be a platform such as this to handle that problem.
